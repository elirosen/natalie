Family therapy is offered on a short term or long term basis, depending on your needs. Based on your goals, family therapy can be used to help navigate relationships and/or assist with effective communication within the family structure. 

If you are a couple or family wanting to pursue therapy, please first book an Initial Consultation session all together so that Dr. Richton can make recommendations for the proper support that you need.
