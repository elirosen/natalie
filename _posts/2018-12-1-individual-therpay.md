Individual therapy is typically offered in weekly 45-minute sessions, but depending on your needs, can be conducted more or less frequently. Initially the focus is on exploring your experience and establishing a mutual understanding of treatment. 

Each session will be tailored to your unique needs and Dr. Richton will check in periodically to ensure that progress is being made. Depending on the issues you are looking for help with, Dr. Richton will help you learn and use specific, proven strategies in sessions as well as in your everyday life in order to reach your goals.
