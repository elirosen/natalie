An initial consultation often consists of a 60-minute session in which Dr. Richton will explore the nature of your current symptoms, concerns, and difficulties.  

During this time, Dr. Richton will work together with you to come up with a focused, personalized plan for your treatment based on your specific needs. Dr. Richton will provide recommendations and will determine how best she can help you meet your agreed-upon treatment goals.
