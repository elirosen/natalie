Psychological services for children, adolescents and adults

I specialize in treatment for mood and anxiety difficulties. My clinical expertise focuses on a wide range of problems, including:
 
  * Anxiety 
  * Panic
  * Worry 
  * Depression 
  * Eating disorders 
  * Behavioral problems 
  * Emotion regulation
  * Test anxiety
  * Sports-performance anxiety
  * Parenting techniques and relationship problems

I also have consistent success helping the individuals I work with increase their use of effective coping strategies and minimize painful, problematic symptoms and behaviors.
