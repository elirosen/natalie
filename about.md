## About Dr. Richton

I am a licensed clinical psychologist providing therapy to children, adolescents, and adults coping with a variety of challenges. I am committed to helping individuals solve numerous problems, promote personal growth, and make desired changes to enhance life experiences. I establish a foundation built on trust, empathy, and productivity, through which I collaborate with my clients to tailor treatment to their specific needs. 
I build a strong therapeutic relationship where my clients feel comfortable working towards achieving their goals, incorporating CBT, DBT, ACT and family systems theory. I use my extensive background in evidence-based treatment to provide each individual with optimal care.

In addition to my private practice, I serve as Program Director and supervisor at Backcountry Wellness. In my role there, I supervise other clinicians and treat those struggling with eating disorders and disordered eating.

## How I Can Help

I specialize in treatment for mood and anxiety difficulties. My clinical expertise focuses on a wide range of problems, including anxiety, panic, worry, depression, eating disorders, behavioral problems, emotion regulation, test anxiety, sports-performance anxiety, parenting techniques and relationship problems. I also have consistent success helping the individuals I work with increase their use of effective coping strategies and minimize painful, problematic symptoms and behaviors.
