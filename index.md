I specialize in treatment for mood and anxiety difficulties. My clinical expertise focuses on a wide range of problems, including anxiety, panic, worry, depression, eating disorders, behavioral problems, emotion regulation, test anxiety, sports-performance anxiety, parenting techniques and relationship problems. I also have consistent success helping the individuals I work with increase their use of effective coping strategies and minimize painful, problematic symptoms and behaviors.
